To create a Linux service to run the provided script script.sh, you can follow these steps:

Create the script file:

Open a text editor and copy the contents of the script into a new file.
Save the file as script.sh in a suitable location, such as /home/proves/Desktop/NodeXXXX/CP.
Make the script executable:

Open a terminal.
Run the following command to make the script executable:
bash
 
chmod +x /home/proves/Desktop/NodeXXXX/CP/script.sh
Create a systemd service file:

Open a terminal.
Run the following command to create a new service file:
 
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/script.service
In the editor, paste the following content into the file:
makefile
 
[Unit]
Description=Script Service
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/home/proves/Desktop/NodeXXXX/CP/script.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Save the file and exit the editor (Ctrl+O, Ctrl+X in nano).
Enable and start the service:

Run the following commands to enable and start the service:
 
sudo systemctl enable script.service
sudo systemctl start script.service
Now, the script will run as a service on your Linux system. It will start automatically on boot and restart if it fails. You can also manage the service using the following commands:

To stop the service:

sudo systemctl stop script.service
To restart the service:

sudo systemctl restart script.service
To check the status of the service:

sudo systemctl status script.service
Note: Replace NodeXXXX with the actual name of the directory where your Python script is located. Additionally, the script assumes you have Python 3 installed and the main.py file is present in the specified directory.
